**Thoughts**: With the previous line chart (AVG_CTR), we can now link the efficiency of the platform to the cost of the campaign. This provides a clear visual representation of how performance measures relate to expenditure over time. The higher the actual ratio (CTR), the greater the cost.

**Thoughts**:Here, we can discern several insights about each of the four campaigns:

Lead Generation: This campaign is widely effective and proliferative, though it incurs significant costs.

Engagement: Known for its widespread reach, low costs, and high effectiveness, engagement campaigns stand out as the most efficient.

Conversion: Despite its widespread adoption and relatively low costs, conversion campaigns are considered the least effective among the four.

Brand Awareness: While it is one of the least proliferative campaigns, brand awareness campaigns demonstrate good effectiveness at the lowest cost.
